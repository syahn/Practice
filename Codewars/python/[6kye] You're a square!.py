# Problem

# A square of squares

# You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

# However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

# Task

# Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

# In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.
# The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.

# Examples

# is_square (-1) # => false
# is_square   3 # => false
# is_square   4 # => true
# is_square  25 # => true
# is_square  26 # => false

# Initial solution( complexity: time=>O() space=>O())

from math import sqrt

def is_square(n): 
  return n > -1 and sqrt(n) - round(sqrt(n)) == 0


# Improved solution( complexity: time=>O() space=>O() )

from math import sqrt

def is_square(n):
    return n > 0 and sqrt(n).is_integer()
